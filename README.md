# CellSimulator
Cell simulation project made over the course of a day(+/-) for a computer science class.

Cells have 4 states: Looking for food, looking for mate, mating and dying. When cells are born, theres a chance of DNA mutation.

White blood cells have 2 states: Tagging and Killing. They tag cells that have a badly mutated DNA. If a mutated cell is tagged, it may be killed by a white blood cell in "kill mode"
